    <h1>MES Kalladi College Mannarkad</h1>
    <p>MES Kalladi College, Mannarkkad is the proud symbol of the Muslim Educational Society, Calicut to the cause of higher education in Kerala, especially to the educationally backward areas of Malabar. This is the first college started by the MES and it is also the felicitous outcome of the noble endeavor of the late Kalladi Cheriya Kunhammed Sahib and the local public. College is located in a vast area, a major part of which was donated by the late Janab Valayadi Kunhayammu Haji.</p>
